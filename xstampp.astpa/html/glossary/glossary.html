<h3 id="accident">ACCIDENT</h3>
undesired or unplanned event that results in a loss, including loss or injury to
human life, property damage, environmental pollution, mission loss etc.
<h3 id="actuator">ACTUATOR</h3>
a human operator or mechanical device tasked with directly acting upon a process
and changing its physical state. Valve systems (valve + the motor associated to it), doors,
magnets (their electronic controller and power source included) or a nurse are actuators that
respectively implement control on the following processes: &quot;fluid flow&quot;, &quot;egress availability&quot;,
&quot;beam position&quot;, &quot;patient position&quot;. Actuators, like sensors, can be smart in that they can be
programmable; they may therefore need to be studied with the same concepts as the controllers
are.
<h3 id="causal factor">CAUSAL FACTOR</h3>
cause of a <a href="#scenario">(hazardous) scenario</a> (STPA Step 2).
<h3 id="command">COMMAND</h3>
a signal providing a set of instructions (goals, set points, order) issued by a
controller with the intent of acting upon a process by activation of a device or implementation of
a procedure. Communication and Control, along with Hierarchy and Emergence, are
fundamental systems theory concepts at the foundation of STAMP. Commands are issued by
Controllers, with the intent that they be implemented by Actuators to act on the Controlled
Process
<h3 id="control-action">CONTROL ACTION</h3>
the bringing about of an alteration in the system&apos;s state through activation
of a device or implementation of a procedure with the intent of regulating or guiding the
operation of a human being, machine, apparatus, or system. They are the result of an Actuator
implementing a control Command issued by a Controller, and aim at controlling the state of the
Controlled Process
<h3 id="control-structure">CONTROL STRUCTURE</h3>
hierarchy of process loops created to steer a system&apos;s operations and
control its states. In the context of a hazard analysis, we are most concerned with the control of
hazardous states aimed at eliminating, reducing or mitigating them.
<h3 id="controlled-process">CONTROLLED PROCESS</h3>
 although at times reducible to the state of a physical element (e.g.
framing a &quot;door&quot; as a controlled process whose values can be &quot;open&quot; or &quot;shut&quot;), it appears
fruitful to rather consider the controlled process identified in STAMP process loops to be the
system&apos;s attribute or state variable that the controller aims to control (e.g. thinking of the door
not as the controlled process but, together with its motor, as an actuator that implements control
on the possibility of egress).
<h3 id="controller">CONTROLLER</h3>
a human or automated system that is responsible for controlling the system&apos;s
processes by issuing commands to be implemented by system actuators.
<h3 id="feedback">FEEDBACK</h3>
 evaluative or corrective information about an action, event, or process that is
transmitted to the original or controlling source..
<h3 id="hazard">HAZARD</h3>
 system state of set or conditions that, together with a particular set of worst-case
environmental conditions, will lead to an accident.
<h3 id="loss">LOSS</h3>
 decrease in amount, magnitude or degree including destruction or ruin.
<h3 id="safety">SAFETY</h3>
 freedom from loss.
<h3 id="safety-constraint">SAFETY CONSTRAINT</h3>
 bound set on system design options and operations to restrict, compel
to avoid or forbid the performance of actions that would lead to a hazard.
<h3 id="design-requirement">SAFETY/DESIGN REQUIREMENT</h3>
 design requirement formulated to include the enforcement of safety
constraints as a design objective.
<h3 id="scenario">(HAZARDOUS) SCENARIO</h3>
 an account or synopsis of a possible course of action or events
resulting in a hazard. See Causal Factor.
<h3 id="sensor">SENSOR</h3>
 human or mechanical device tasked with measuring a process variable by responding
to a physical stimulus (as heat, light, sound, pressure, magnetism, or a particular motion) and
transmit a resulting impulse (as for measurement or operating a control)..
<h3 id="uca">UNSAFE CONTROL ACTION</h3>
 control action that leads to a hazard (STPA Step 1).
