		To gain an overview of the current progress of a project A-STPA can create a configurable Progress Report.
		The Report can either be viewen directly in XSTAMPP or exported as a Excel sheet in the .xlsx format.
		<p>As can be seen in the Progress Indicators Wizard the report can be further refined with setting parameters
		 to set the definition-of-done to adapt the Progress Indicators to the project requirements.</p>

		 		<td>Safety Constaints per Accident</td>
		 		<td>The amount of Safety Constraints that need to be defined and analysed in order for an accident to be considered done.
		 		 A Safety Constraint is considered analysed when a <a href="../step0/designReq.html">Design Requirement</a> was created and linked to it

		 		<td>The amount of Unsafe Control Actions(UCA) that need to be created and analysed for a Control Action(CA) in order for the CA to be considert done.
		 		 A UCA can either be hazardous if it is linked to more than one hazards or not hazardous.
		 		 <br>If a UCA is hazardous then it is only considert to be analysed once the analysis of all hazards has been
		 		  completed (The hazard must be linked to an analysed accident).
		 		  <br>If the UCA is not hazardous than it is automatically considered analysed.

		 		A Causal Factor is considered analysed for a UCA if Safety Constraints and Design Requirements have been defined for the UCA entry.
