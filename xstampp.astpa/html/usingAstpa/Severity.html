		In this dialog the Severity of the entry (Hazard or Accident) can be defined by using the below definitions.
		<ul>
		<li>A severity can be chosen by double clicking the respective item from the list
		<li>By selecting an item the respective severity description is displayed in the green Popup
		</ul>
		<table>
		<tr>
			<td>S0</td>
			<td>No Safety Effect:<br>
			Failure Conditions that would have no effect on safety
			(that is, Failure Conditions that would not affect the operational capability
			of the automated driving vehicle or increase/impose workload for passengers,
			operators and/or other traffic participants).
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>S1</td>
			<td>Minor:<br>
			Failure Conditions that would not significantly reduce
			automated driving vehicle safety and involve passenger,
			operator or traffic participant actions that are well within their capabilities.
			Minor Failure Conditions may include a slight reduction in safety margins
			or functional capabilities or a slight increase in workload
			(such as route/global path changes)</td>

			<td>S2</td>
			<td>Hazardous:<br>
			Failure Conditions that would significantly reduce the capability
			of the ad vehicle or the ability of the  operators/other traffic participants
			to cope with adverse operating conditions to the extent that there would be the following:
			<ul>
			<li>a large reduction in safety margins or functional capabilities; or
			<li>Physical distress or higher workload such that the  operators/other traffic participants cannot be relied upon to perform their tasks accurately or completely; or
			<li>Physical distress to operators/passengers/other traffic participants, possibly including injuries.

			<td>S3</td>
			<td>Catastrophic:<br>
			Failure conditions that would render the AD vehicle or the operators/other traffic participants
			incapable to cope with adverse operating conditions, resulting in
			<ul>
			<li>one or multiple fatalities
			<li>or serious injury to passengers/other traffic participants,
			<li>or the persistent loss of the ability to control the driving path of the ad
