			Control Actions, added in the view labeled &quot Control Actions&quot, can have multiple <a href="../../glossary/glosssary.html#uca">Unsafe Control Action(UCA)</a> that can be marked as <b>hazardous</b> by linking it to one or more <a href="../../glossary/glosssary.html#hazard">Hazards</a>.<br> A Control Action can have UCA's in <a href="ucaSettings.html"><b>four(customizable) categorys</b></a>, which are each represented by one column in the table:

					<td>1</td><td>Not providing causes hazard</td>

					<td>2</td><td>Providing incorrect causes hazard</td>

				<h4>Setting the Severity</h4>
					The severity of an UCA can only be defined if the severity analysis has been activated in the <a href="../projectSettings.html">Project Settings</a>.<br>
					The current severity of an UCA can be seen and edited in the <img src="../../images/severity_widget.PNG">. By clicking on the widget a severity can be chosen form the <a href="../Severity.html">Severity dialog</a>.<br>
					If an UCA is linked to one or more Hazards than its' severity is automatically set to be higher or equal to the highest severity of the linked Hazards.
				<h4>Editing and Deleting an Unsafe Control Action </h4>
					In the center part of an UCA entry a description can be added to the UCA or it the UCA can be deleted from the project.<br>
					To edit the description simply click on the gray are in the center to open a text editor, all changes applied can also be <a href="../../../../xstampp/html/gettingstarted/generell.html#undo">undone</a>.<br>
					To delete an entry click on <img src="../../../icons/buttons/grid/DeleteButton_InCell_16.png"> which will open a pop-up asking to confirm the deletion <b>Note that this can not be undone</b>
				<h4>Link a Hazard to an Unsafe Control Action </h4>
					When linked to a Hazard, the corresponding Control Action is marked unsafe and will 
					appear in the Corresponding Safety Constraints Table. <img src="../../images/ucaLinking.png">  is used to link a Control 
					Action to a Hazard. Press <img src="../../images/ucaLinking.png">  and a list of available Hazards will pop up. Link a Hazard 
					by doubleTclicking on it.
			<p><h3 id="adding">Adding new Unsafe Control Actions</h3>
			<img src="../../images/ucaAdd.png"> can be used to describe the status of the system when the Control Actions is not 
					given,  was given incorrectly,  had wrong timing or was stopped too soon. This status can 
					be linked to a Hazard.
