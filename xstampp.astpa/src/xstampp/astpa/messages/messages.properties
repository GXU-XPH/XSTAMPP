ControlStructure_NameMustBeUnique=The name for the control structure must be unique\!
ControlStructure_New=New Control Structure
DeleteControlStructureQuestion=Do you really want to delete the Control Structure %s?\n\nNote that this will delete all entries and is not undo able!
DeleteControlStructureTitle=Delete Control Structure %s
ListOfCAEditPart_ToolTip0=A List component in which Control Action components\ncan be placed by drag&dropping them inside the component borders
ProjectSpecifics_GeneralSettings=General
ProjectSpecifics_ReopenHazardView=The Hazard View must be reopened
ProjectSpecifics_UseCausalScenarios=Use Causal Scenarios
ProjectSpecifics_UseCausalScenariosTip=Use &Scenarios to refine the causal factors in the project,\n this adds a column 'Causal Scenarios' in the Causal Factors Table that allows to define safety constraints per causal scenario 
ProjectSpecifics_UseSeverity=Use Severity Analysis for Hazards
ProjectSpecifics_UseSeverityTip=Use &Severity &Analysis to define the Severity of Hazards:\n\n\
S0\tNo Safety Effect:\n\
\tFailure Conditions that would have no effect on safety\n\
\t(that is, Failure Conditions that would not affect the operational capability\n\
\tof the automated driving vehicle or increase/impose workload for passengers,\n\
\toperators and/or other traffic participants)."\n\n\
S1\tMinor:\n\
\tFailure Conditions that would not significantly reduce\n\
\tautomated driving vehicle safety and involve passenger,\n\
\toperator or traffic participant actions that are well within their capabilities.\n\
\tMinor Failure Conditions may include a slight reduction in safety margins\n\
\tor functional capabilities or a slight increase in workload\n\
\t(such as route/global path changes)"\n\n\
S2\tHazardous:\n\
\tFailure Conditions that would significantly reduce the capability\n\
\tof the ad vehicle or the ability of the  operators/other traffic participants\n\
\tto cope with adverse operating conditions to the extent that there would be the following:\n\
\t\t- a large reduction in safety margins or functional capabilities; or\n\
\t\t- Physical distress or higher workload such that the  operators/other traffic participants\n\
\t\t  cannot be relied upon to perform their tasks accurately or completely; or\n\
\t\t- Physical distress to operators/passengers/other traffic participants, possibly including injuries.\n\n\
S3\tCatastrophic:\n\
\tFailure conditions that would render the AD vehicle or the operators/other traffic participants\n\
\tincapable to cope with adverse operating conditions, resulting in\n\
\t\t- one or multiple fatalities\n\
\t\t- or serious injury to passengers/other traffic participants,\n\
\t\t- or the persistent loss of the ability to control the driving path of the ad\n\
\tvehicle resulting in the uncontrolled loss of the ad vehicle
