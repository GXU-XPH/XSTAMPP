AddGivenIncorrectlyUCA=Add given incorrectly UCA
AddingNewCausalFactor=Adding a new Causal Factor
AddingNewUCA=Adding new UCA
AddNewCausalFactor=Add new Causal Factor
AddNotGivenUCA=Add not given UCA
AddStoppedTooSoonUCA=Add stopped too soon UCA
AddWrongTimingUCA=Add wrong timing UCA
CellButtonAddScenario_ToolTip=Add a new Causal Scenario to the set of\npossible scenarios that can lead to the Causal Factor
CellButtonImportConstraint_ToolTip=Links this Safety Constraint with one defined in Step 1,\nthe constraint will be initially copied\nchanges in this editor will not change the constraint defined in Step 1
CellEditorCausalEntry_ConfirmDeleteUCA=Delete Unsafe Control Action entry?
CellEditorCausalEntry_ConfirmDeleteUCAMsg=Do you really want to delete this Unsafe Control Action entry?\nNote that this will delete the UCA entry and all stored scenarios.\n\nThe Unsafe Control Action itself however will not be deleted
CellEditorCausalEntry_None=none
CellEditorCausalEntry_UseMultipleSCToolTip=Change this Causal Factor\n to use one Safety Constraint
CellEditorCausalEntry_UseOneSCShellMsg=Do you want to switch to use just a single Safety Constraint for this entry?\nPlease choose the initial value of the constraint based on your previouse entries:
CellEditorCausalEntry_UseOneSCShellTitle=Switch to single Safety Constraint
CellEditorCausalEntry_UseOneSCToolTip=Change this Causal Factor\n to use a single Safety Constraint
ControlAction=Control Action
ControlStructure_NameMustBeUnique=The name for the control structure must be unique\!
ControlStructure_New=New Control Structure
CSContextMenuProvider_MoveDOWN=Move Down
CSContextMenuProvider_MoveUP=Move Up
CSContextMenuProvider_MoveUP_DOWNAllWay=To the top/bottom
CSContextMenuProvider_MoveUP_DOWNOneStep=One step
DeleteControlStructureQuestion=Do you really want to delete the Control Structure %s?\n\nNote that this will delete all entries and is not undo able!
DeleteControlStructureTitle=Delete Control Structure %s
GivenIncorrectly=Providing incorrect causes hazard 
GridCellButtonAddCausalFactor_ToolTip=Add a new Causal Factor that can lead to an Unsafe Control Action
GridCellButtonAddUCAEntry_Text=Add Unsafe Control Action
GridCellButtonAddUCAEntry_ToolTip=Add a new entry for an Unsafe Control Action\nthis will allow to formulate Safety Constraints for each Hazard\nin the context of a Causal Factor
ListOfCAEditPart_ToolTip0=A List component in which Control Action components\ncan be placed by drag&dropping them inside the component borders
NotGiven=Not providing causes hazard 
ProjectSpecifics_GeneralSettings=General
ProjectSpecifics_ReopenDesignRequirements=The Design Requirements Editor of step 2 must be reopened\!
ProjectSpecifics_ReopenHazardView=The Hazard View must be reopened
ProjectSpecifics_UseCausalScenarios=Use Causal Scenarios
ProjectSpecifics_UseCausalScenariosTip=Use &Scenarios to refine the causal factors in the project,\n this adds a column 'Causal Scenarios' in the Causal Factors Table that allows to define safety constraints per causal scenario 
ProjectSpecifics_UseSeverity=Use Severity Analysis for Hazards
ProjectSpecifics_UseSeverityTip=Use &Severity &Analysis to define the Severity of Hazards:
Severity_S0=No Safety Effect:\n\
Failure Conditions that would have no effect on safety\
(that is, Failure Conditions that would not affect the operational capability\
of the automated driving vehicle or increase/impose workload for passengers,\
operators and/or other traffic participants)."
Severity_S1=Minor:\n\
Failure Conditions that would not significantly reduce\
automated driving vehicle safety and involve passenger,\
operator or traffic participant actions that are well within their capabilities.\
Minor Failure Conditions may include a slight reduction in safety margins\
or functional capabilities or a slight increase in workload\
(such as route/global path changes)
Severity_S2=Hazardous:\n\
Failure Conditions that would significantly reduce the capability\
of the ad vehicle or the ability of the  operators/other traffic participants\
to cope with adverse operating conditions to the extent that there would be the following:\n\
\t- a large reduction in safety margins or functional capabilities; or\n\
\t- Physical distress or higher workload such that the  operators/other traffic participants\n\
\t  cannot be relied upon to perform their tasks accurately or completely; or\n\
\t- Physical distress to operators/passengers/other traffic participants, possibly including injuries.
Severity_S3=Catastrophic:\n\
Failure conditions that would render the AD vehicle or the operators/other traffic participants\
incapable to cope with adverse operating conditions, resulting in\n\
\t- one or multiple fatalities\n\
\t- or serious injury to passengers/other traffic participants,\n\
\t- or the persistent loss of the ability to control the driving path of the ad\n\
vehicle resulting in the uncontrolled loss of the ad vehicle
StoppedTooSoon=Stopped too soon or Applied too long
UCAHeaderSettings_Column=column 
UCAHeaderSettings_CustomHeadersGroupTitle=Define custom headers for the four categories of Unsafe Control Actions
UCAHeaderSettings_CustomHeadersGroupToolTip=The changes made in this view will then change headers\nfor the Unsafe Control Actions Table Editor and Export
UCAHeaderSettings_Default=Default
UnsafeControlActions=Unsafe Control Actions
UnsafeControlActionsTable=Unsafe Control Actions Table
UnsafeControlActionsView_HeaderToolTip=To change the Unsafe Control Action headers\n\
go to Project -> Settings -> Unsafe Control Actions Table
UnsafeControlActionsView_InvalidSeverityMsg=The selected severity is not valid for this Unsafe Control Action,\n\
the severity must always be greater or equal to that of the linked hazards!
UnsafeControlActionsView_InvalidSeverityTitle=Invalid Severity
WrongTiming=Wrong timing or order causes hazard
