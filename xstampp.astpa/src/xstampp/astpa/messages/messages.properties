ProjectSpecifics_UseSeverity=Use Severity Analysis for Hazards
ProjectSpecifics_UseSeverityTip=Use &Severity &Analysis to define the Severity of Hazards:
Severity_S0=No Safety Effect:\n\
Failure Conditions that would have no effect on safety\
(that is, Failure Conditions that would not affect the operational capability\
of the automated driving vehicle or increase/impose workload for passengers,\
operators and/or other traffic participants)."
Severity_S1=Minor:\n\
Failure Conditions that would not significantly reduce\
automated driving vehicle safety and involve passenger,\
operator or traffic participant actions that are well within their capabilities.\
Minor Failure Conditions may include a slight reduction in safety margins\
or functional capabilities or a slight increase in workload\
(such as route/global path changes)
Severity_S2=Hazardous:\n\
Failure Conditions that would significantly reduce the capability\
of the ad vehicle or the ability of the  operators/other traffic participants\
to cope with adverse operating conditions to the extent that there would be the following:\n\
\t- a large reduction in safety margins or functional capabilities; or\n\
\t- Physical distress or higher workload such that the  operators/other traffic participants\n\
\t  cannot be relied upon to perform their tasks accurately or completely; or\n\
\t- Physical distress to operators/passengers/other traffic participants, possibly including injuries.
Severity_S3=Catastrophic:\n\
Failure conditions that would render the AD vehicle or the operators/other traffic participants\
incapable to cope with adverse operating conditions, resulting in\n\
\t- one or multiple fatalities\n\
\t- or serious injury to passengers/other traffic participants,\n\
\t- or the persistent loss of the ability to control the driving path of the ad\n\
vehicle resulting in the uncontrolled loss of the ad vehicle
StoppedTooSoon=Stopped too soon or Applied too long
UCAHeaderSettings_Column=column 
UCAHeaderSettings_CustomHeadersGroupTitle=Define custom headers for the four categories of Unsafe Control Actions

go to Project -> Settings -> Unsafe Control Actions Table
WrongTiming=Wrong timing or order causes hazard
