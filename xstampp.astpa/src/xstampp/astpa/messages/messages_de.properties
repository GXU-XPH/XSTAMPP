ProjectSpecifics_UseSeverityTip=Severity Analyse nutzen um die Severity Hazards zu definieren:\n\n\
S0\tNo Safety Effect:\n\
\tFailure Conditions that would have no effect on safety\n\
\t(that is, Failure Conditions that would not affect the operational capability\n\
\tof the automated driving vehicle or increase/impose workload for passengers,\n\
\toperators and/or other traffic participants)."\n\n\
S1\tMinor:\n\
\tFailure Conditions that would not significantly reduce\n\
\tautomated driving vehicle safety and involve passenger,\n\
\toperator or traffic participant actions that are well within their capabilities.\n\
\tMinor Failure Conditions may include a slight reduction in safety margins\n\
\tor functional capabilities or a slight increase in workload\n\
\t(such as route/global path changes)"\n\n\
S2\tHazardous:\n\
\tFailure Conditions that would significantly reduce the capability\n\
\tof the ad vehicle or the ability of the  operators/other traffic participants\n\
\tto cope with adverse operating conditions to the extent that there would be the following:\n\
\t\t- a large reduction in safety margins or functional capabilities; or\n\
\t\t- Physical distress or higher workload such that the  operators/other traffic participants\n\
\t\t  cannot be relied upon to perform their tasks accurately or completely; or\n\
\t\t- Physical distress to operators/passengers/other traffic participants, possibly including injuries.\n\n\
S3\tCatastrophic:\n\
\tFailure conditions that would render the AD vehicle or the operators/other traffic participants\n\
\tincapable to cope with adverse operating conditions, resulting in\n\
\t\t- one or multiple fatalities\n\
\t\t- or serious injury to passengers/other traffic participants,\n\
\t\t- or the persistent loss of the ability to control the driving path of the ad\n\
\tvehicle resulting in the uncontrolled loss of the ad vehicle
