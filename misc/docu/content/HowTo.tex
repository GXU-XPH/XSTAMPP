\section{How to build XSTAMPP}

\begin{enumerate} 
\item The build requires \href{https://maven.apache.org/}{Maven} ($>=3.3$) and \href{http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html}{Java} ($>1.7$) either from $https://maven.apache.org/$ or from the IDE
\item go to the xstampp.parent directory in the root path of the xstampp project (where this file is located)
\item open a command in the xstampp.parent dir and execute 
	\begin{enumerate} 
	\item 'mvn clean verify' to build xstampp with xstpa and cast already included
	\item 'mvn clean install' as 3.1 but also installs xstampp on $[user]/.m2$ for usage as local dependency of other builds
	\end{enumerate} 
\item the build artifacts are located in the astpa.repository/target
