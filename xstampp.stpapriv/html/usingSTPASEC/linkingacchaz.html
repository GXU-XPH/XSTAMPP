			view. While in Loss mode, Losses can be selected from the big list in the middle of 
			the window to show all Vulnerabilities available for linking. By clicking on <img src="../images/linkingSwitch.png">
			 the big list in the middle can be used to select a Vulnerability in order to show all Vulnerabilities
